This is a repo with some smaller projects/assignments from my studies - SGH Warsaw School of Economics & Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology.

I have decided to include only a handful of projects where I had room to develop my own solution in order to avoid any sort of concerns about plagiarism of lecturers' codebase, or revealing their tasks content.

Each project is logically grouped into subdirectories:

Econometric Methods - this one was a course from SGH Warsaw School of Economics where I had to deliver an R project & project report to analyze certain dataset with econometric methods. I have scraped COVID-19 data from Worldometers (sadly - I have lost my scraper's source code :() and created, analyzed and evaluated econometric models with some ggplot visuaizations. I have included the report (in Polish) and the dataset in repository.

Programming Practice - this was a course from Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology where we were training various programming concepts & patterns using Groovy. We had to deliver a project at the end that solves some sort of problem and I have decided to create a simple Groovy script that connects to jokeapi API to retain some programmer humor jokes and save it into .txt file.

Service Integration [Java] - this one was a course from Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology where we were learning about microservices using Java. This one is a project based on Spring & JMS that implemented pub/sub messaging model on an example of some sort of communication between teams in imaginary car racing.

Service Integration [Python] - this is another project from the above course, where I implemented a simple API using Django that interacts with data of imaginary quotes & their authors, along with Postman collection to test it.
